Several abbreviated versions of the Marlowe-Crowne scale have been proposed and adopted in psychology and medicine. In this article I evaluate the adequacy of 9 short forms using confirmatory factor analysis across 2 samples (combined N = 867). There was some evidence for the adequacy of different short forms, but model adequacy was not consistent across samples. Supplementary analyses revealed a multidimensional structure to the full Marlowe-Crowne scale and indicated that the apparent adequacy of model fit for some short forms might be a statistical artifact. Using the Marlowe-Crowne scale or its various short forms as a control for response bias is discouraged on empirical and conceptual grounds.},

  abstract = {In the German General Survey 2000 (ALLBUS), the so-called `Sealed Envelope Technique' (SET), was utilized to obtain data on an individuals' self-admitted delinquency. The focus of this article is to discover, particularly, the reason respondents refused to fill in this confidential questionnaire in spite of the guaranteed anonymity. From a theoretical perspective of subjective expected utility, the assumption is that respondents are interested in maximizing benefits and avoiding social costs in the interview situation. Consequently, responses provided are optimal realizations of the respondents' interest. Furthermore, the respondents' intellectual capacity in understanding the questions, the SET applied, the interviewer characteristics, and aspects of the interview situation, were presumably responsible for refusals on sensitive questions. The ALLBUS 2000 data confirm these hypotheses. The selectivity of self-reported delinquency on matters concerning fare avoidance and tax evasion also resulted in biased model estimators of determinants regarding anticipated future delinquency. Mail survey is one supported view on improving data quality in self-admitted acts of delinquency. However, before firm conclusions can be drawn, more empirical data is needed on the processes and mechanisms involved in a respondents refusal to answer questions on delinquency.},

  abstract = {One of the core activities of market research is the collection of data by interviewing. Three developments have strongly influenced this activity: decreasing response rates, higher interviewing costs, and the growing awareness that the respondent needs to be treated like a 'real' customer. These developments have led to new ways of sampling (from ad hoc to access panels) and to using other methods of collecting data (from CATI/CAPI to CASI). The effects of the different methods or modes of collecting data are the focus of this paper. In this study the effects of the sampling procedure are explicitly distinguished from the effects of the modes of data collection. In particular, this split between sampling and modality effect provides new insights into the field of data collection. Research conducted by TNS NIPO and two universities shows that when using CASI, without in interviewer, socially unacceptable behaviour is more easily admitted. At the same time, using CASI, the respondent will be less sensitive to evaluation apprehension and show less socially desirable behaviour. CASI also leads to less extreme answers, more deliberation and more unaided recall of brand names, for example. Overall, the presence or absence of an interviewer appears to influence the interviewees. Therefore one has to be careful when data are collected through different modes.},

  abstract = {Background Interviewer-administered surveys are an important method of collecting population-level epidemiological data, but suffer from declining response rates and increasing costs. Web surveys offer more rapid data collection and lower costs. There are concerns, however, about data quality from web surveys. Previous research has largely focused on selection biases, and few have explored measurement differences. This paper aims to assess the extent to which mode affects the responses given by the same respondents at two points in time, providing information on potential measurement error if web surveys are used in the future. Methods 527 participants from the third British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3), which uses computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) and self-interview (CASI) modes, subsequently responded to identically-worded questions in a web survey. McNemar tests assessed whether within-person differences in responses were at random or indicated a mode effect, i.e. higher reporting of more sensitive responses in one mode. An analysis of pooled responses by generalized estimating equations addressed the impact of gender and question type on change. Results Only 10\% of responses changed between surveys. However mode effects were found for about a third of variables, with higher reporting of sensitive responses more commonly found on the web compared with Natsal-3. Conclusions The web appears a promising mode for surveys of sensitive behaviours, most likely as part of a mixed-mode design. Our findings suggest that mode effects may vary by question type and content, and by the particular mix of modes used. Mixed-mode surveys need careful development to understand mode effects and how to account for them.},

Method Using a list experiment, we examine whether Democrat (and liberal) opposition to the building of a wall at the Mexican border and to the deportation of undocumented immigrants are due to societal pressures to adopt inclusive positions and whether Republicans (and conservatives) hide their negative immigrant attitudes. Results We find that Democrats and liberals' views on these two issues do indeed reflect their true preferences. Conversely, we find that Republicans and conservatives do feel the need to conceal their anti-immigrant stances. Conclusion Our results suggest that the extent of asymmetric polarization on immigration policy might even be larger because partisans also differ in their social desirability concerns.},

These types of topics include, for example, racism, ableism, cheating, and stealing, among others. Referred to as sensitive topics, their investigation usually involves questions that require respondents to admit to attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that violate social norms, making their assessment susceptible to error due to social desirability bias. This article describes an empirical investigation of an approach to minimize this bias, the use of forgiving language in survey item development and the effect on item variability. Using secondary data initially collected as part of a measurement development study of mental health providers' stigmatization of service users, 15 pairs of similar, thematically targeted items, varying with respect to wording approach were tested using a purposive sample of mental health providers (N=220). Findings indicate that items crafted in a forgiving manner were not significantly influenced by social desirability bias, in contrast to items developed in more traditional language. Additionally, forgiving language-items produced higher levels of agreement, on average, when compared to those written in more traditional language. More research is indicated, including systematic variation of wording approaches, but these results seem promising.},

Secondly, the main errors that may crop up when recording such phenomena are dealt with. Then, we move down to the level of the indicators used. The effectiveness of the traditional indicators used in CIS surveys, which are compared with {$<<$} new {$>>$} indicators applied earlier in the European Social Survey (2002-2003), is assessed using the articulation of multivariate analytical techniques (cluster and discriminant) in both analysis and validation samples. These,new,, indicators end up by showing greater effectiveness when measuring attitudes against immigration, due mainly to the question format adopted in the questionnaire. Nevertheless, measurement errors are still detected and some proposals for dimensions, indicators and question formats are given in order to help advancing in the complex detection of latent racism and xenophobia.},

Consistent with our hypothesis, some support for the social desirability bias and survey mode effects was obtained. Self-administration of questionnaires encouraged declarations of xenophobia, but more so when subtle or indirect scales of rejection versus acceptance of immigrants were used. The drawback was the under-representation of respondents with a low level of education in self-administered methods.

In this article it is argued that the assumptions underlying such practice are doubtful, because SD-scores may be affected by a variety of factors but the tendency to present oneself favourably. Two such factors related to the question-answering process are discussed in more detail. Empirical support is provided that these factors may explain the relationship between the score on a SD-scale and age.

Diese Fiktion kann in zwei Aspekten zusammengefa\ss t werden: Erstens seien die bei der Befragung gemessenen Werte das Resultat einer stabilen latenten Eigenschaft von Personen, dem ,,wahren Wert``, und (unsystematischen) Abweichungen davon, den ,,Fehlern``. Zweitens habe die latente Eigenschaft, die sich durch die Messung in ihrer Auspr\"agung feststellen lasse, eine angebbare Beziehung zum Verhalten au\ss erhalb der Situation der Datenerhebung. Beide Annahmen stehen im Zentrum aller Vorkehrungen f\"ur die Sicherstellung der internen und externen Validit\"at von Messungen in der empirischen Sozialforschung. Die klassische Testtheorie (vgl. z.B. Frederick M. Lord und Melvin R. Novick 1968) beruht auf der Annahme stabiler latenter Merkmale, ebenso wie die darauf aufbauenden Verfahren zur Identifikation der G\"ute von Me\ss instrumenten. Den Begriff der ,,Verzerrung`` und des ,,Fehlers`` kann es einsichtigerweise nur vor dem Hintergrund eines solchen stabilen und relevanten Bezugspunktes geben.},

However, previous research has only insufficiently examined the specific features that make certain ethnically prejudicial statements subtler, i.e., less readily identifiable as xenophobic, than others. The current study employs an experimental factorial survey design and assesses the subtlety of systematically manipulated prejudicial statements. Our data from a German random population sample (N = 895) indicate that the subtlety of ethnically prejudicial statements is manipulable along the dimensions of topic, linguistic (essentialist) phrasing, and target group: Prejudicial statements that refer to culture, that are phrased weakly essentialistically, and that target Muslims were subtlest, in being evaluated as least xenophobic by the respondents. Moreover, with an increasing internal and a decreasing external motivation to respond without prejudice, individuals reacted more strongly to the variation of the statements' topic and linguistic phrasing and were thus more sensitive to features determining subtler and more blatant ways of ethnic prejudice expression. These findings contribute to a better understanding of current migration discourses, in demonstrating that the specific manner in which ethnic prejudice is communicated can camouflage the xenophobic nature of a statement, so that it is less readily recognized as prejudicial.},

If citizens are unwilling to reveal certain policy preferences to others, surveys may fail to characterize population preferences accurately. The innovation of this paper is to use unique data that allow one to measure biases in surveyed preferences for a broad range of public policies. I combine data on 184 referenda held in Switzerland between 1987 and 2007 with postballot surveys that ask how the citizens voted for each proposal. The difference between stated preferences in the survey and revealed preferences at the ballot box provides a direct measure of survey bias. I find that these biases vary by policy area, with the largest occurring in policies on immigration, international integration, and votes involving liberal or conservative attitudes. Also, citizens show a tendency to respond in accordance with the majority.},

Results indicate that in-person administration was largely equivalent to the randomly assigned online sample (Sona Systems) in terms of their intercorrelations, mean scores, variability, and reliability. However, the Sona sample consistently responded with strong attitudes for all measures, suggesting that social desirability may be decreased when completing these measures online. In addition, the Mechanical Turk sample differed in many ways from both in-person and Sona administration; although this nonequivalence is at least partially explained by sample demographic differences, other considerations may have exacerbated nonequivalence, including prior exposure to the measures and a desire to respond correctly.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of individual attitudes toward immigration emphasize concerns about labor-market competition as a potent source of anti-immigrant sentiment, in particular among less-educated or less-skilled citizens who fear being forced to compete for jobs with low-skilled immigrants willing to work for much lower wages. We examine new data on attitudes toward immigration available from the 2003 European Social Survey. In contrast to predictions based on conventional arguments about labor-market competition, which anticipate that individuals will oppose immigration of workers with similar skills to their own but support immigration of workers with different skill levels, we find that people with higher levels of education and occupational skills are more likely to favor immigration regardless of the skill attributes of the immigrants in question. Across Europe, higher education and higher skills mean more support for all types of immigrants. These relationships are almost identical among individuals in the labor force (that is, those competing for jobs) and those not in the labor force. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, then, the connection between the education or skill levels of individuals and views about immigration appears to have very little, if anything, to do with fears about labor-market competition. This finding is consistent with extensive economic research showing that the income and employment effects of immigration in European economies are actually very small. We find that a large component of the link between education and attitudes toward immigrants is driven by differences among individuals in cultural values and beliefs. More educated respondents are significantly less racist and place greater value on cultural diversity than do their counterparts; they are also more likely to believe that immigration generates benefits for the host economy as a whole.The authors would like to thank Beth Simmons, Shigeo Herano, Mike Tomz, James Alt, Jeffry Frieden, Ron Rogowski, Ken Scheve, Torben Iversen, Andy Baker, and Peter Gourevitch for helpful comments on earlier drafts.},

An unobtrusive questioning technique known as the list experiment is used to measure Americans' support for immigration restrictionism. The list experiment can easily be embedded in a standard telephone survey and has been used by previous investigators to study racial attitudes. Results. Restrictionist sentiments are found to be more widespread among the U.S. populace than previous studies have estimated, especially among college graduates and political liberals. Conclusion. My findings have implications for immigration scholars and social scientists who study other sensitive attitudes and behaviors. The most commonly employed strategies to reduce socially desirable responding may not be enough.},

  abstract = {Objective.-When gathering sensitive information about personal experiences such as child abuse, drug and alcohol use, and intimate partner violence (IPV), it is especially important for both research and clinical purposes to use optimal methods to limit socially desirable responses. The purpose of this paper is to determine which of the following 3 methods is optimal for gathering data: 1) face-to-face interviews, 2) self-administered paper and pencil questionnaires, or 3) audio computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASI). Methods.-The sample consisted of 514 parents bringing their preschoolers (0-5 years) to a pediatric primary care clinic for a checkup. The parent screening questionnaire (PSQ) addressing psychosocial problems was completed by participants themselves. Participants completed the PSQ in I of 3 ways: paper and pencil, face-to-face interview, or directly onto a computer (ACASI). Results.-In general, ACASI yielded the highest rates for sensitive problems such as social isolation and parental stress, with face-to-face interviews occupying an intermediate position. The differences between ACASI and self-administered paper and pencil questionnaires were significant for many items. The differences between ACASI and face-to-face interviews, however, were modest. There were no significant group differences among the 3 methods in the prevalence rates of the neutral, less sensitive items. Conclusion.-ACASI resulted in greater disclosure of sensitive information than did a paper and pencil approach. No significant differences were observed between the computer-assisted interview and the face-to-face interview, both done in a research setting. The 3 methods appeared similar when gathering less sensitive data.},

This article reviews theoretical explanations of socially motivated misreporting in sensitive surveys and provides an overview of the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of specific survey methods designed to encourage the respondents to answer more honestly. Besides psychological aspects, like a stable need for social approval and the preference for not getting involved into embarrassing social interactions, aspects of the survey design, the interviewer's characteristics and the survey situation determine the occurrence and the degree of social desirability bias. The review shows that survey designers could generate more valid data by selecting appropriate data collection strategies that reduce respondents' discomfort when answering to a sensitive question.},

Unlike the vast majority of RRT surveys measuring the prevalence of socially undesirable behaviors, only few studies have explored the effectiveness of the RRT with respect to the disclosure of socially undesirable opinions. Results suggest that the RRT is an effective method eliciting more socially undesirable opinions and yielding more valid prevalence estimates of xenophobia and anti-Semitism than direct questioning ('more-is-better' assumption). Furthermore, the results indicate that with increasing topic sensitivity, the benefits of using the RRT also increase. Finally, adapted logistic regression analyses show that several covariates such as education and generalized trust are related to the likelihood of being prejudiced towards foreigners and Jews.

Literature on empirical social research often recommends either positive "loading" of sensitive questions, e.g. using "forgiving" wording, or manipulating the question context to reduce social desirability bias. We derive theoretical explanations of how manipulations of question wording and context could elicit more socially undesirable answers in sensitive surveys. In an experimental online survey (N = 1,176), we evaluate the effects of (1) forgiving wording and (2) question context on social desirability bias in different sensitive questions. The empirical evidence on the assumed bias-reducing effects shows inconsistent results. It is indicated however, that the perceived social norm has the strongest and most consistent effect on the respondents' propensity to self-report socially undesirable behavior.},

The items in the three scale versions varyingly referred to immigrants using the three terms. Results showed differences in attitudes toward unauthorized immigration between all experimental conditions. The label ``illegal immigrants'' yielded significantly less positive attitudes compared to the label ``undocumented immigrants,'' and respondents exposed to the label ``illegal aliens'' showed the most positive attitudes. Furthermore, the effects of the experimental conditions were not moderated by the respondents' patriotism, sex, or own immigrant background.}

  abstract = {The measurement of anti-immigrant sentiment (AIS) is treacherous. Manifestations of animosity, or even misgivings, might be associated with racism and xenophobia. Thus, survey respondents with unwelcoming attitudes may make incorrect statements when asked about their feelings toward immigrants, or indeed other attitude facets regarding international migration.  To reduce such measurement error (commonly labelled \textquestiondown social desirability bias\textquestiondown, SDB), survey methodologists have developed various anonymity-maximizing techniques. One such is the list-experiment, also known as item-count-technique (ICT), which consists of dividing the sample in treatment and control arms with a view to comparing the mean scores obtained when asking about the number of items that elicit a specific attitude or assessment. The item of interest is included only in the treatment group\textquestiondown s list. Since no request is made to identify the relevant items, just the number, the method assumes that respondents will answer truthfully. Comparison with the percentage obtained by a direct question on the same sensitive item is supposed to reveal the scope of SDB. This paper reports on a list-experiment on AIS fielded in Spain in the framework of a study on immigration attitudes financed by the European Fund for Regional Cohesion and the Spanish Ministry of Science (project ref. CSO2017-87364-R). Contrary to expectations, aggregate ICT-based estimates of AIS almost coincide with those based on the DQ. At face value, this result suggests the absence of social desirability pressures. However, hidden beneath those aggregate values lurks evidence of SDB substantial enough to question the list-experiment\textquestiondown s \textquestiondown no liars\textquestiondown{} assumption.}

  abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that the respondents' approval motive, their desirability beliefs and the privacy of the response situation affects respondents' susceptibility to social desirability bias. Previous research has analyzed the explanatory power of these factors separately and has not taken their possible interdependence as determinants for social desirability bias into account. This article tests the prediction from rational-choice theory that a strong approval motive, clear differences in the perceived desirability of response options and a lack of privacy are all necessary but not sufficient conditions for social desirability bias. According to the empirical results from our first study a three-way interaction between the analyzed factors predicts respondents' racial attitude reports. However, since attitude answers and desirability beliefs were collected in the same interview, the observed associations may be an artifact due to subjects' sensitization for social desirability concerns. This possibility is tested in a second study, where only racial attitude answers were collected under conditions of varying response privacy. Aggregated response differences between the utilized attitude items and respondents' social group affiliation were matched with equivalent differences in the desirability beliefs found in the first study. The results from the main study were replicated with this independent sample of respondents.},

The validity of the most frequently used indicator for desirability beliefs, the one-point measure, depends on the neutrality and monotonic assumptions to be empirically valid. In the current study, the authors examine these completely untested assumptions by drawing on data about topics that are often the subject of survey research. These are prejudice against the elderly, charitable donations, voting in political elections, and environmental consciousness. The authors find that the neutrality assumption does not hold for substantial parts of the sample for all topics and the monotonic assumption is not valid for two of them. They introduce two new, more elaborated measures for desirability beliefs that allow for the valid prediction of SD bias when either one or both of the otherwise necessary assumptions do not hold.},

In the second factor, the part of the questionnaire with presumed sensitive questions is administered via computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI), instead of completely administering the questionnaire via computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). No significant main effect of the promised incentive on the response rates could be found. There are, however; interactions between the incentive, gender, and ethnicity, which show that different subpopulations react differently to the promised incentive. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the data collected by means of CASI results in more valid answers. Still, when the data are collected by means of CASI a substantial increase in the rate of "don't know" responses is observed.},

  abstract = {This article assesses the validity of responses to sensitive questions using four different methods. In an experimental setting, the authors compared a computer-assisted self-interview (CASI), face-re-face direct questioning, and two different varieties of randomized response. All respondents interviewed had been identified as having committed welfare and unemployment benefit fraud. The interviewers did not know that respondents had been caught for fraud and the respondents did not know that the researchers had this information. The results are evaluated by comparing the percentage of false negatives. The authors also looked for variables that might explain why same respondents admit fraud and others do not. The proportions of respondents admitting fraud are relatively low, between 19 percent and 49 percent. The two randomized response conditions were superior in eliciting admissions of fraud. A number of background variables, notably gender; age, still receiving benefit, and duration and perception of fraud are related to admitting fraud Although the randomized response conditions performed much better than face-to-face direct questioning and CASI, the percentage of respondents admitting fraud is only around 50 percent. Some possible reasons for this are discussed.},

  abstract = {Muslim Americans constitute one of the United States' most vulnerable minority groups, facing frequent discrimination from both the public and the government. Despite this vulnerability, few studies evaluate interventions for reducing prejudice against Muslim Americans. Building from an insightful literature on the sources of prejudice against Muslim Americans, this paper tests whether attitudes can be improved with information countering misperceptions of the community as particularly foreign, threatening, and disloyal to the United States. The experimental treatment modestly improved attitudes, including among some subgroups predisposed to prejudice against Muslim Americans. However, the treatment struggled to change policy views, and it demonstrated some vulnerability to social desirability bias and priming on terrorism threats. The findings suggest that information campaigns addressing misperceptions can help to reduce prejudice on the margins, but primarily in less politicized contexts.},

Das folgende Kapitel unternimmt den Versuch, die Theoriel\"ucke etwas zu verkleinern und Befragtenverhalten allgemein und speziell im RRT-Modus theoretisch zu erkl\"aren und dadurch zu empirisch testbaren Hypothesen zu gelangen. Hierzu werden in Unterkapitel 3.1 zun\"achst die theoretischen Fragen konkretisiert, der gr\"o\ss ere Theorierahmen abgesteckt, einschl\"agige erkl\"arende Ans\"atze identifiziert, sowie die Auswahl der behandelten Ans\"atze begr\"undet. Der Pr\"asentation der ausgew\"ahlten Ans\"atze sind die darauffolgenden Unterkapitel gewidmet. In Unterkapitel 3.2 wird \textendash{} nach einer kurzen Diskussion des generellen Rational Choice (RC)-Ansatzes \textendash{} auf das RC-Modell des Befragtenverhaltens, das auf Esser (1986, 1991) zur\"uckgeht, eingegangen. Dessen Modell, in dem ausschlie\ss lich Social Desirability (SD)-motivierte Antworteditierungen thematisiert werden, wird anschlie\ss end erweitert und auf die RRT bezogen. Eine hier noch offen bleibende Frage nach weiteren Gr\"unden f\"ur Antwortverzerrungen wird im Rahmen der neueren Frame-Selektionstheorie (FS-Theorie) behandelt. Deren Vorstellung erfolgt in Unterkapitel 3.3. Hier wird zun\"achst ausf\"uhrlicher auf die generelle Konzeption des Ansatzes eingegangen, bevor der Bezug zur Erkl\"arung des Befragtenverhaltens hergestellt wird. Dies geschieht deshalb, weil sich die Framing-Theorie als \"ubergreifende Handlungstheorie versteht, welche Schwachstellen des relativ etablierten RC-Ansatzes \"uberwinden soll. Um zu einem Urteil \"uber deren Leistungsf\"ahigkeit zu gelangen, macht es daher Sinn, sich zun\"achst allgemein mit der Theorie auseinanderzusetzen.},

  abstract = {This paper presents empirical evidence on a recent advancement of the item count technique (ICT, a survey technique for asking sensitive questions), namely, the person count technique (PCT; Grant, Moon, \& Gleason, 2014). PCT utilizes person lists instead of lists of filler questions, as is the case in the classic ICT design. This simplifies the questioning procedure, but leads to some methodological challenges such as floor and ceiling effects. The main part of this paper presents empirical evidence stemming from an experimental postal survey in Germany (N = 580) investigating how well PCT performs as compared to standard direct questioning (DQ) with regard to alleviating misreporting for questions on attitudes towards refugees. PCT prevalence estimates for hostile attitudes towards refugees are significantly higher than DQ estimates for one item, and non-significantly higher for three items. Although not consistently significant, the differences are substantial, amounting to a threefold increase of the proportion of respondents expressing negative attitudes towards refugees. Even though the findings are not unequivocally in favor of PCT, this new ICT variant still deserves consideration in the future and warrants further development. Specifically, more knowledge is required with respect to its statistical properties and the best practices of its implementation.},
